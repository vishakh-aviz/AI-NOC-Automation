# Runbook — NCP MCP-connector prompt validation

Sends chat prompts to NCP for each connector — 20 network prompts for Nexus Dashboard, Catalyst Center,
Zabbix, ONES and 16 GPU-metric prompts for Prometheus and DCGM — reads the right answer straight from each
product's own API, and grades NCP's answer by code.
Background and details: `CLAUDE.md` (start at §0).

## 1. Before you start

- **Python 3.10 or newer** and `pip`.
- **A machine on the lab network** that reaches NCP (`10.4.5.10` since 2026-10-07) and the sources:
  Nexus Dashboard `10.20.11.3`, Catalyst Center `10.4.5.230`, Zabbix `10.4.4.177:8088`, ONES `10.20.0.37`,
  Prometheus `10.20.0.41:9091` (Prometheus and DCGM), BCM `10.20.13.243:8081` (client-certificate PEM),
  vLLM `10.4.5.33:8000` and `10.20.11.73:8120` (Dynamo).
- **The `.env` file** in the project folder. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and ask Dev for the values
  (NCP password, source logins). Never commit `.env` or paste it into a chat or ticket.
- **The connector `#tags` exactly as in the NCP UI**: on 10.4.5.10 `#nexus-mcp`, `#catalyst-mcp`, `#zabbix`, `#ones-37-mcp`
  (the ONES tag must point at the same ONES as `ONES_URL`), `#prometheus-mcp`, `#dcgm`, `#bcm`, `#dynamo-mcp`.

## 2. One-time setup

```bash
cd AI-NOC-Automation
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Run — in this order

| Step | Command | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| Self-tests (no network) | `pytest` | `261 passed` in ~15 s. If not, stop — setup problem |
| Check the sources | `pytest test_sources.py` | 8 passed in ~30 s; one summary line per connector |
| Smoke test (one prompt) | `pytest test_main.py --connectors ones --prompts P02` | 1 result in ~20 s |
| Full run (131 tests) | `pytest test_main.py` | ~40–60 min; 8 connectors run side by side |

A live run first checks `.env` and the NCP login. If something is missing it stops at once
(exit code 2) and names the key — fix `.env` and run again.

## 4. Useful options

| You want | Add |
|---|---|
| Some connectors | `--connectors zabbix,ones` (or `-k zabbix`) |
| Some prompts | `--prompts P01,P07` (GPU: `G06`, BCM: `B03`, Dynamo: `V04`); GPU connectors only: `--connectors prometheus,dcgm`; BCM, Dynamo, DCGM: `--connectors bcm,dynamo,dcgm` |
| One prompt, watch it live (console logs) | `-n 0` |
| One prompt sheet for every selected connector | `--excel path/to/sheet.xlsx` (default: each connector's own sheet) |

Example: `pytest test_main.py --connectors catalyst --prompts P03 -n 0`

## 5. Results

Reports land in `reports/` (one set per run, never overwritten):
- `NCP_MCP_Prompt_Results_<time>.html` — open in a browser; rewritten after every test, so you can
  watch a run. Click a row: NCP's answer **next to the source data**, follow-ups, tools, retries.
- `NCP_MCP_Prompt_Results_<time>.xlsx` — Summary, Matrix, Details, **Failures** (start triage here).
- `snapshots/<connector>.json` — what each source returned (from the source check).

| Result | Means |
|---|---|
| PASS | NCP's answer matches the source |
| FAIL | wrong, missing or invented data — the reason says which |
| NA | the product has no such data, and NCP said so |
| BLOCKED | the suite could not read the source — not an NCP result |
| XFAIL | failed, but the prompt has a known bug id in the sheet |

Expected today: Nexus P18 and ONES P16 are BLOCKED (no temperature / no link endpoint). Nexus prompts FAIL
until Nexus Dashboard's LAN-Fabric service is back (CLAUDE.md §3.10). A PASS whose reason starts with
`partial:` means NCP showed only part of the data and all of it matched — the reason lists what was not
shown (`PARTIAL_PASS=0` in `.env` makes those FAIL). A FAIL is repeated once in a new chat: "flaky: …" = failed
first, passed on repeat (PASS); "failed twice" = FAIL. Each test also shows NCP's own tool calls ("NCP tool
calls": e.g. "1 failed: manage_listFabrics → HTTP 500"). "read via the LLM
reader" = an LLM copied NCP's answer into a table and the code graded that table (shown in the report).

## 6. If something goes wrong

| You see | Do |
|---|---|
| `Blank in .env: …` | fill the named keys in `.env` |
| `Cannot log in to NCP …` | check `NCP_HOST` / `NCP_PASSWORD`; log in to the NCP UI from the same machine |
| `unrecognized arguments: -n 8 --dist loadgroup` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` (pytest-xdist missing) |
| Every prompt FAILs with a connection error | wrong socket URL: set `NCP_WS_URI` in `.env` |
| A FAIL you think is wrong | repeat it once in a new chat: `pytest test_main.py --connectors X --prompts Pnn`; passes now = flaky, not a bug |

## 7. Rules

- The suite only **reads** from NCP and the sources. Never add write calls.
- Never loosen a check to make a test pass — fix the source mapping or ask Dev.
- After any code change run `pytest` (must stay green) and log the change in `CLAUDE.md` §12.
- Send Dev: the run's `.html` + `.xlsx`, the snapshots, and for each suspected NCP bug the test id
  and conversation id.
