"""How the suite behaves in a chat: when NCP asks a follow-up, what to reply, how long to wait.
Pure functions, no network.

Based on (Automation 2, read 2026-10-06):
  USECASE-AUTOMATION-2026/ai_core.py   is_followup_question, generate_refined_prompt, get_dynamic_timeout
  DC-INVENTORY/ai_core.py              handle_conversation_with_followup: a definite "no data"
                                       answer is final, no follow-up is sent
  Ticketing/ai_core.py                 is_followup_question: an image / chart is an answer;
                                       scoping and "try again" phrases
CHANGED 2: fixed replies instead of LLM-written ones (the old LLM was told: "always ask for the
  COMPLETE data set; 'all devices' unless the prompt names one" — the fixed replies do that).
CHANGED 11: every reply starts with the connector #tag as its own word. Measured 2026-10-06
  (conversations 3204-3206): "(#zabbix)" inside a sentence loses the connector ("the Zabbix
  connector isn't enabled"); "#zabbix ..." first keeps it. The run before had 5 FAILs from this.
CHANGED 12: no follow-up after a definite "no data" answer, an image / chart, or a table.
